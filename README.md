## 🔍 Project Overview

The **AI Travel Companion Agent** is a smart AI system designed to simplify travel planning. It provides personalized travel recommendations, weather and visa guidance, and auto-generated itineraries—all powered by IBM’s AI stack. This project demonstrates the use of advanced NLP techniques and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a user-friendly, intelligent travel assistant.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Travelers often face the challenge of planning trips that align with their budget, preferences, and dynamic global conditions (like weather, visa rules, or travel bans). Manual research is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.

---

## 💡 Solution

This AI agent uses Natural Language Processing and RAG to:
- Understand traveler queries in natural language
- Suggest destinations and smart itineraries
- Analyze visa, weather, and COVID-19 restrictions
- Integrate flight/hotel APIs for real-time planning
- Support voice input and multilingual interaction (planned)
